# AGI Notes

## Required Components

### Sensory interfaces
Necessary because agents need feedback from environment in order to reason. 

### Motor interfaces

### Aknowledgement of the subjectivity
When someone talks to the agent or when when the agent reads a books there is always subjectivity in the information.  
Second source of subjectivity is the way we process the incoding information.

      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```

### Learning

It's unlikely to know everything, especially because knowledge is about abstract ideas and those are subjective.  
Required learning scenarios (the list is not exhaustive and probably overlapping):
- Agent's action had an effect -> associate the action with the effect
- Expected effect wasn't observed -> invalide the association between the cause and the expected effect, look for more complex theory of the relation
- Another agent gives new information about a hierarchical relation between ideas (a don is an animal) -> learn the abstract relation


### Abstraction Processing
Processing of raw inputs from sensory interfaces into abstract ideas is required because abstract ideas help to learn.   
The agent can only learn statistics from raw input (requiring tons of raw input), while abstract ideas allow the agent to apply different reasoning methods that don't require tons of examples (this is why few-shot "learning" works so well).  

### Reasoning
Reasoning is an essential step of learning.
