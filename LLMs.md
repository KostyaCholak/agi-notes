## Learning
Learning is one of the most problematic components of LLM on a way to AGI.  
At the momemnt learning can be done in two ways:
1. Fine-tuning
2. Few-shot learning

Few-shot learning is not sufficient because it doesn't affect the long-term memory.  
Fine-tuning uses backpropagation to update already pretrained model with new datapoints.  
Unlike few-shot iit requires hundreds or thousands of training examples.

Fine-tuning also uses abstract representation
